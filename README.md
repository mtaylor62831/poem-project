# poem-project
code to generate randomized blackout poetry

This is an experiment in using text parsing with a script to create random poetry similar to newspaper blackout poems.
Primarily it's for me to get in some practice with js.

For a more sophisticated example that check out Max Kremlin's code here: https://mkremins.github.io/blackout/
