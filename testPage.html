<p>James Andrews Beard was born in <a href="/wiki/Portland,_Oregon" title="Portland, Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, in 1903 to Elizabeth and John Beard.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> His mother operated the Gladstone Hotel, and his father worked at the city's <a href="/wiki/Customs_house" class="mw-redirect" title="Customs house">customs house</a>. The family vacationed on the Pacific coast in <a href="/wiki/Gearhart,_Oregon" title="Gearhart, Oregon">Gearhart, Oregon</a>, where Beard was exposed to <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest_cuisine" title="Pacific Northwest cuisine">Pacific Northwest cuisine</a>.
</p><p>Common ingredients of this cuisine are <a href="/wiki/Salmon" title="Salmon">salmon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shellfish" title="Shellfish">shellfish</a>, and other fresh <a href="/wiki/Seafood" title="Seafood">seafood</a>; <a href="/wiki/Game_(food)" class="mw-redirect" title="Game (food)">game</a> meats such as <a href="/wiki/Moose" title="Moose">moose</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elk" title="Elk">elk</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Venison" title="Venison">venison</a>; <a href="/wiki/Mushroom" title="Mushroom">mushrooms</a>, <a href="/wiki/Berry" title="Berry">berries</a>, small <a href="/wiki/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a>, <a href="/wiki/Potato" title="Potato">potatoes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kale" title="Kale">kale</a>, and wild plants such as <a href="/wiki/Fiddleheads" class="mw-redirect" title="Fiddleheads">fiddleheads</a> or young pushki (<i><a href="/wiki/Heracleum_maximum" title="Heracleum maximum">Heracleum maximum</a></i>, or cow parsnip).
</p><p>Beard's earliest memory of food was at the 1905 <a href="/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Exposition" class="mw-redirect" title="Lewis and Clark Exposition">Lewis and Clark Exposition</a>, when he was two years old. In his <a href="/wiki/Memoir" title="Memoir">memoir</a> he recalled:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
I was taken to the exposition two or three times. The thing that remained in my mind above all others—I think it marked my life—was watching <a href="/wiki/Triscuit" title="Triscuit">Triscuits</a> and shredded wheat biscuits being made. Isn't that crazy? At two years old that memory was made. It intrigued the hell out of me.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>At age three Beard was bedridden with <a href="/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, and the illness gave him time to focus on the food prepared by his mother and their <a href="/wiki/Chinese_people" title="Chinese people">Chinese</a> helper.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> According to Beard he was raised by Thema and Jue-Let, who instilled in him a passion for <a href="/wiki/Chinese_culture" title="Chinese culture">Chinese culture</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Beard reportedly "attributes much of his upbringing to Jue-Let," whom he refers to as his Chinese godfather.<sup id="cite_ref-Saveur_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Saveur-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>David Kamp wrote, "In 1940 he realized that part of his mission [as a food connoisseur] was to defend the pleasure of real cooking and fresh ingredients against the assault of the Jell-O-mold people and the domestic scientists."<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Beard lived in France during the 1920s, where he experienced <a href="/wiki/French_cuisine" title="French cuisine">French cuisine</a> at its bistros.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> After this exposure and the widespread influence of French food culture, he became a <a href="/wiki/Francophile" title="Francophile">Francophile</a>.

<p>After training as a singer and actor, Beard moved to <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> in 1937. Unlucky in the theater, he and friend Bill Rhodes capitalized on the <a href="/wiki/Cocktail_party" title="Cocktail party">cocktail party</a> craze by opening Hors d'Oeuvre, Inc., a <a href="/wiki/Catering" title="Catering">catering</a> company. This led to lecturing, teaching, writing, and the publication of Beard's first cookbook in 1940: <i>Hors D'Oeuvre and Canapés</i>, a compilation of his catering recipes. According to fellow cooking enthusiast <a href="/wiki/Julia_Child" title="Julia Child">Julia Child</a>, this book put him on the culinary map.<sup id="cite_ref-childsvi_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-childsvi-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> rationing ended Beard's catering business. From August 1946 to May 1947, he hosted <i><a href="/wiki/I_Love_to_Eat" title="I Love to Eat">I Love to Eat</a></i>, a live television cooking show on NBC, beginning his ascent as an American food authority. According to Child, "Through the years he gradually became not only the leading culinary figure in the country, but 'The Dean of American Cuisine'."<sup id="cite_ref-childsvi_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-childsvi-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1952, when <a href="/wiki/Helen_Evans_Brown" title="Helen Evans Brown">Helen Evans Brown</a> published her <i>Helen Brown's West Coast Cook Book</i>, Beard wrote her a letter igniting a friendship that spanned until Brown's death. The two, along with her husband Phillip, developed a friendship which was both professional and personal. Beard and Brown became like siblings, admonishing and encouraging each other, as well as collaborating.<sup id="cite_ref-Ferrone_(1995)_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ferrone_(1995)-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>
According to the James Beard Foundation website, "In 1955, he established The James Beard Cooking School. He continued to teach cooking to men and women for the next thirty years, both at his own schools (in New York City and Seaside, Oregon), and around the country at women's clubs, other cooking schools, and civic groups. He was a tireless traveler, bringing his message of good food, honestly prepared with fresh, wholesome, American ingredients, to a country just becoming aware of its own culinary heritage."<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>
Beard brought French cooking to the American middle and upper classes during the 1950s, appearing on TV as a cooking personality. David Kamp (who discusses Beard at length in his book, <i>The United States of Arugula</i>) noted that Beard's was the first cooking show on TV.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> He compares <a href="/wiki/Dione_Lucas" title="Dione Lucas">Dione Lucas</a>' cooking show and school with Beard's, noting that their prominence during the 1950s marked the emergence of a sophisticated, New York-based, nationally  and internationally known food culture.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Kamp wrote, "It was in this decade [the 1950s] that Beard made his name as <i>James Beard</i>, the brand name, the face and belly of American gastronomy."<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> He noted that Beard met <a href="/wiki/Alice_B._Toklas" title="Alice B. Toklas">Alice B. Toklas</a> on a trip to Paris,<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> indicative of the network of fellow food celebrities who would follow him during his life and carry on his legacy after his death.
</p><p>Beard made endorsement deals to promote products that he might not have otherwise used or suggested in his own cuisine, including <a href="/wiki/Omaha_Steaks" title="Omaha Steaks">Omaha Steaks</a>, <a href="/wiki/French%27s" title="French&#39;s">French's</a> Mustard, <a href="/wiki/Green_Giant" title="Green Giant">Green Giant</a> Corn Niblets, <a href="/wiki/Old_Crow" title="Old Crow">Old Crow</a> bourbon, <a href="/wiki/Planters" title="Planters">Planters Peanuts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shasta_(soft_drink)" title="Shasta (soft drink)">Shasta</a> soft drinks, <a href="/wiki/DuPont" title="DuPont">DuPont</a> chemicals, and <a href="/wiki/Lawry%27s_and_Adolph%27s" title="Lawry&#39;s and Adolph&#39;s">Adolph's Meat Tenderizer</a>. According to Kamp, Beard later felt himself a "gastronomic whore" for doing so. Although he felt that mass-produced food that was neither fresh, local nor seasonal was a betrayal of his gastronomic beliefs, he needed the money for his cooking schools.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> According to Thomas McNamee, "Beard, a man of stupendous appetites—for food, sex, money, you name it—stunned his subtler colleagues."<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> In 1981, Beard and friend <a href="/wiki/Gael_Greene" title="Gael Greene">Gael Greene</a> founded <a href="/wiki/Citymeals-on-Wheels" title="Citymeals-on-Wheels">Citymeals-on-Wheels</a>, which continues to help feed the homebound elderly in New York City.

<p><a href="/wiki/Julia_Child" title="Julia Child">Julia Child</a> summed up Beard's personal life:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Beard was the quintessential American cook. Well-educated and well-traveled during his eighty-two years, he was familiar with many cuisines but he remained fundamentally American. He was a big man, over six feet tall, with a big belly, and huge hands. An endearing and always lively teacher, he loved people, loved his work, loved gossip, loved to eat, loved a good time.<sup id="cite_ref-childsvi_13-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-childsvi-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>

Beard's also had an admission of having "until I was about forty-five, I guess I had a really violent temper."<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Mark_Bittman" title="Mark Bittman">Mark Bittman</a> described him in a manner similar to Child's description: </p><blockquote><p>In a time when serious cooking meant French Cooking, Beard was quintessentially American, a Westerner whose mother ran a boardinghouse, a man who grew up with hotcakes and salmon and meatloaf in his blood. A man who was born a hundred years ago on the other side of the country, in a city, Portland, that at the time was every bit as cosmopolitan as, say, <a href="/wiki/Allegheny,_Pennsylvania" title="Allegheny, Pennsylvania">Allegheny, Pennsylvania</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>After Beard's death in 1985, Julia Child wanted to preserve his home in New York City as the gathering place that it had been during his life. <a href="/wiki/Peter_Kump" title="Peter Kump">Peter Kump</a>, a former student of Beard's and the founder of the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Culinary_Education" title="Institute of Culinary Education">Institute of Culinary Education</a> (formerly Peter Kump's New York Cooking School), spearheaded efforts to purchase the house and create the <a href="/wiki/James_Beard_Foundation" title="James Beard Foundation">James Beard Foundation</a>.
